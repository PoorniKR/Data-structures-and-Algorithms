## Data Structures

### Arrays
- Description: Fixed-size data structure that stores elements of the same type.
- Operations:
  - Accessing elements by index: O(1)
  - Insertion and Deletion: O(n)

### Linked Lists
- Description: A dynamic data structure where elements are connected via pointers.
- Types: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List
- Operations:
  - Traversal: O(n)
  - Insertion/Deletion at the beginning: O(1)

### Stacks
- Description: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
- Operations:
  - Push, Pop, Peek: O(1)

### Queues
- Description: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
- Operations:
  - Enqueue, Dequeue: O(1)

### Trees
- Description: A hierarchical data structure with nodes connected by edges.
- Types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Operations:
  - Search, Insertion, Deletion in BST: O(log n)

### Graphs
- Description: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
- Representations: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List
- Operations:
  - Traversal: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: O(n^2)
- **Merge Sort**: O(n log n)
- **Quick Sort**: O(n log n) average case
- **Insertion Sort**: O(n^2)

### Search Algorithms
- **Linear Search**: O(n)
- **Binary Search**: O(log n) (works on sorted arrays)

### Graph Algorithms
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: O(V + E)
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: O(V + E)
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Shortest path algorithm (O(E + V log V))

### Dynamic Programming
- **Fibonacci Series**: O(n)
- **Knapsack Problem**: O(nW) where n is the number of items, W is the capacity of the knapsack.
